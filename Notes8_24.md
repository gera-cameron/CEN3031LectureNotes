#Intro To SWE
---
- Software frequently cost more that the hardware it runs on
- The cost of maintaining software typically exceeds its development costs
  - For legacy systems, 80% of the total cost can be due to maintenance

>SWE is concerned with making Software development cost effective

#SWE
- May not be needed for small systems
- But you'd be silly not to apply it in some form to larger ones unless you...
  - have an infinitely large budget and/or..
  - don't care if the product is ever delivered
