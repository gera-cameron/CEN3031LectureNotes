##Requirements engineering
Diagram of customer interaction with system analyst that leads to system architecture

3 steps:
1. Requirement elicitation analysis
  - System description
2. Requirements specification
  - User and system Requirements
3. Validate Requirements
  - Requirements document

##Implementation & Testing

##Dealing with changing requirements
###Due to uncertainty
When what the system is is poorly defined/not well understood...
####System Prototype
  - Developed quickly (perhaps using Prototyping language/tool)
  - Purpose: To understand the impact of design decisions
  - Error checking & recovery are typically *not* considerations
  - Focused of *functional requirements[what the system does]* (rather than non-functional requirements)
  - Tends to disregard important things like reliability & security
####Remember
  > Prototypes are meant to be disregarded! They are not meant to be the foundation for production software!
