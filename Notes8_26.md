#Software products

##Generic products

- Standalone systems that are marketed to anyone who wants to buy them
- Product specification: the producer decides what features will be supported
  - Easier to avoid requirement changes(aka requirements creep)

##Customized Products

- Software commissioned by a specific customer to meet their own needs
- Product specifications: the entity commissioning the product that decides what features will be supported
  - Generally, you want to keep the customer happy, so requirements creep is frequently an issue

#SWE History

Earliest mention: 1966 - arose in recognition of the difficulty of creating more complex systems
Idea: Apply standard engineering techniques to Software development

> Problem: Often the scope of the problem is poorly and/or incompletely understood
- e.g., development of space-flight required multiple iterations to learn what would and wouldn't work - there was a general idea of what, but the knowledge of how was incomplete.
- Poorly defined systems have a high risk of failure, and tend to be:
  - Expensive
  - Take a lot longer to achieve (if ever) than initially projected
- Problem: Standard engineering problems do not have requirements changing during the course of the project and when they do change, everyone accepts that it's going to cost more and take longer

=> "Waterfall" model of development: Analysis -> Design Phase -> Implementation -> Testing -> Release

In the 1990's there were some prominent Software pros who felt dissatisfied with the way software was being developed(design first, then Implementation didn't seem fun) => Agile Software Development

##Is "Waterfall" dead?

Not by a long shot. There are problem domains that agile techniques are very suited to (in particular, those where the problem domain is not well understood or feature creep is likely)

There are others, where exact behavior is required (e.g., nuclear reactor control system), or the clients' contracting requirements are not consonant with a collaborative, agile approach.

Another place where agile methods currently have some difficulty being applied is when there are large teams working on a problem, especially, when distribution in different locations

##SW Development from a management perspective

- Management wants to be able to... Manage.
- Just because a company claims to be using agile techniques, doesn't mean that it is.
- Management often doesn't want to listen to what the developers are telling there

#Software Engineering Ethics

Some issues:
- Confidentiality
- Competence
- IP Right
- Computer misuse
